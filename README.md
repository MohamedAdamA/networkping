Why NetworkPing
NetworkPing solves a common need: understanding network health without getting lost in technical noise. Real-time monitoring makes it possible to respond quickly to outages, degraded links, or routing issues. Clear visualizations translate raw numbers into actionable insight. Privacy protections ensure you control what data leaves your device or network. The open-source license invites collaboration, transparency, and accountability.

Key Features
- Real-time Monitoring: See latency, jitter, packet loss, and throughput as they happen. The dashboard updates continuously to reflect current conditions.
- Data Visualization: Interactive charts, heatmaps, and timelines help you understand trends and identify outliers. You can zoom, filter, and compare metrics across time ranges.
- Privacy Protection: Local processing modes, minimal data collection, and configurable retention policies keep your information under your control.
- Open-Source and Free: You can inspect the code, customize it, and contribute to the project. No license fees or vendor lock-in.
- Cross-Platform: Works on major desktop and server environments. Designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal dependencies.
- Extensible: A modular design makes it straightforward to add new probes, new visualizations, or export formats.
- Alerts and Notifications: Optional alerting rules that trigger when metrics cross thresholds. Integrates with common notification channels.

How NetworkPing Works
NetworkPing collects timing data from your network environment and processes it locally or in a privacy-conscious cloud setup. It performs periodic probes to target endpoints, measures round-trip time, and records packet loss. The collected data is aggregated to produce meaningful indicators of connection quality. The visualization layer presents this information through dashboards and charts. The architecture favors low overhead so it can run alongside other network tools without causing interference.

- Probing: Lightweight probes generate synthetic traffic to measure latency, jitter, and packet loss. Probes adapt to network conditions to avoid causing congestion.
- Data Aggregation: Raw measurements are summarized into statistics such as mean, median, min, max, and percentiles. Aggregation helps you identify consistent patterns versus occasional spikes.
- Visualization: A responsive dashboard renders charts and graphs. Users can switch between time frames, compare endpoints, and highlight anomalies.
- Privacy Controls: Data handling is configurable. In default mode, sensitive data remains on the device. Optional telemetry can be disabled entirely.
- Extensibility: The core logic offers plug-in points for new probe types, new data processors, and new visualization widgets.

Architecture and Design
NetworkPing follows a clean, modular design that supports growth and maintainability. Core ideas include separation of concerns, explicit interfaces, and a focus on low resource usage. The user interface, data processing, and data collection are decoupled so you can swap parts of the stack as needed.

- Core: The central engine handles scheduling, data collection, and storage. It ensures data integrity and stable operation under varying loads.
- Probes: Individual probes implement measurement logic for different targets or protocols. Probes can be added without changing the core.
- Data Layer: A lightweight store holds recent measurements and derived metrics. It supports both in-memory and on-disk storage modes.
- Visualization Layer: The UI renders dashboards, charts, and tables. It supports interactive exploration and export options.
- API Layer: A simple, well-documented API enables automation, scripting, and integration with other tools.
- Security: The design minimizes data exposure and provides clear boundaries between local processing and optional remote components.
